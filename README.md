# Natalie Parser

This is a **very** work-in-progress parser for the Ruby programming language. It was extracted from the [Natalie](https://github.com/natalie-lang/natalie) project.

Probably best not to use this apart from Natalie for awhile. There's still a lot of work to be done... (Feel free to help!)
